# Work that can be handed to a subagent

Each entry is meant to be pasted into a ticket more or less as it stands. Anything
without a way to *measure* whether it worked is not ready to hand out — write the
measurement first.

## Every ticket runs in its own git worktree

    tools/worktree.sh <name>

prints a directory, a branch, and the `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to export. The agent works THERE and
commits to ITS OWN BRANCH; the coordinator merges back with `git merge --no-ff`. Nothing else
gets an agent's half-finished edits, and nobody has to remember not to build at the wrong moment.

Why this exists: on 2026-09-07 four separate incidents came from agents and coordinator sharing
one checkout. A build taken while a worker held `src/` compiled its half-finished file and
returned a normal-looking number; the same collision later made a build fail outright; and I told
a worker its correct measurement was contamination on the strength of one of those numbers.

What the script handles that a bare `git worktree add` does not:
- `reference/bn6f` is a submodule and a fresh worktree checks it out EMPTY. It is symlinked to
  the main checkout, because it is only ever READ -- disassembly comments are made by the
  coordinator in the main tree, so an agent must not commit inside it. The script marks the
  path `--skip-worktree` so that a stray `git add -A` cannot stage the symlink over the
  gitlink -- doing that once merged a self-referential symlink into main and deleted the
  disassembly from the working tree. Agents should stage by path regardless.
- Each worktree needs its own `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` or the builds serialise on one lock. A build in
  a fresh worktree takes about 30 seconds and produces a BYTE-IDENTICAL ROM to the main tree's --
  verified, three ways, so a number measured in a worktree is directly comparable to one measured
  anywhere else.
- Capture scratch paths are keyed on the checkout path by `chip_compare.scratch()`, so two agents
  cannot overwrite each other's packed ROM between its build and its capture. That needed no
  argument and no convention; it just works out.

An agent that commits on its own branch is also free to commit MIDWAY, which the old "never
commit" rule forbade -- and that rule existed only because everyone shared one tree.

## Rules for every ticket

- **Give each agent its own `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`** under `/tmp` (`tools/worktree.sh` prints one). `cargo` locks the shared
  target directory and every build overwrites the same `target/.../bn` that
  `tools/gbafix.py` reads, so two agents building at once will silently pack each
  other's ROM. This has already caused two wrong captures.
  This rule was itself a trap until 2026-09-07: `regress.py`'s `build()` hardcoded
  `ROOT/target/...`, so setting `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` made cargo build in one place and the
  ROM get packed from a stale ELF in another -- no error, just numbers for a different
  build (`mettaur` 95436 instead of 345). It now asks `cargo metadata` where the target
  directory actually is, so the rule and the harness finally agree. Any OTHER script that
  packs a ROM should be checked for the same assumption before being trusted under a
  private target dir.
- **Baseline first.** The agent must record the number with its own script *before*
  changing anything, and re-run the identical script afterwards, and report both. A
  change nobody can show improves a number is not a fix — see 7ah in `TRANSFER.md`,
  where a well-cited change backed by a disassembly line and the animation data turned
  out to move nothing and to be worse on a wider window.
- **Say which window was measured.** Two agents measuring the same residue in different
  frame windows reached opposite conclusions once. Windows go in the report.
- Only `src/` changes unless the ticket says otherwise. Never `tools/`, `reference/`,
  `assets/` or `Cargo.toml` without a reason in the report.
- A precise negative result is a good outcome and gets written into `TRANSFER.md`. A
  plausible-sounding change that does not move the number is not.
- **DO THE WORK YOURSELF.** Do not delegate a ticket onward to a further agent. You
  are the worker. A ticket that turns out to be bigger than it looked comes back as a
  report saying so, not as a subcontract. (Which model runs which role is decided in
  `.pi/agents/` and HANDOFF §13, not by the worker.)

## Rules for whoever is handing the tickets out

Written after breaking all three of these in one evening.

- **Do not build or measure from the tree while a worker holds `src/`.** Not just "do not edit" --
  a build taken mid-edit compiles whatever state the worker's file is in at that instant and gives
  a number that looks completely normal. This produced a `tiles` reading of 3295 and then one of 0
  within the hour, the second being a build with the worker's fix reverted. Reuse an already-built
  ROM from /tmp, or wait.
- **When a worker's number disagrees with yours, rebuild it yourself before contradicting them.**
  On the strength of the above I told a worker its correct measurement was contamination. It had
  done three from-scratch builds and was right. Its EXPLANATION was wrong (it blamed target-path
  length; three target directories, one deliberately long, give a byte-identical ROM) -- but a
  wrong explanation is not a wrong measurement, and the two must be judged separately.
- **`git add -u <path>` limits to that path.** A commit meant to carry the fix, the harness change
  and two write-ups carried only the submodule bump, and the rest sat unstaged behind a clean-
  looking `git status` line. Check `git show --stat` after committing, not just the exit code.

## R. Root states as recipes (HANDOFF §13 step 1)

- R1 DONE -- Rebuild the fixture chain from power-on. 
- R2 NEGATIVE -- Move the chip rows onto the never-had-an-enemy fixture. At the event-pinned alignment (canon CurState leaves 0x0804 at frame 3
- R3 PARTIAL -- A battle that never spawns an enemy. The roll's choice lands in `GameState->CurBattleDataPtr` at `0x02001b9c` (stored at
asm29.s:10286, read by `sub_800531C` asm00_1.s:4455)
- R4 BLOCKED -- Keep the enemy-less battle alive, then finish R3. Step 1 done, and it overturns the recon: none of the five literal `SubsystemIndex=0x10`
stores, the warp entry, `cs_warp_cmd` or the script 
- R5 PARTIAL -- A write watchpoint in the capture tool, then find what releases the empty battle. Step 1 done, verified, committed (17dc00f, plus HANDOFF §5 row)
- R6 NEGATIVE -- The state oracle: first divergent field, not just a pixel count. On `wt/r6-oracle` at `c504eee`, the export was pixel-neutral: `wave` 0/0/90 (negative 3840), `window` 0/0/16 (81056), `mettaur` 30864/1566/7
- R7 DONE -- Land the state oracle on the facts R6 found. Merged `a9d08b7` as `2b35d4b`
- R8 WITHDRAWN -- Usage logging: primitive profiles for the 43-chip corpus. 
## F. Convergence: every existing row to 0 differing frames before anything new (user, 2026-09-12)

Tickets run in this order; the coordinator takes the first OPEN one. Queue by leverage, from the
2026-09-12 full table (isolated unless noted): F4 opening 1160 (was 0) -> F5 the chip-row fixture
(28 rows at exactly 14388, 11 more above it) -> F6 tiles/gauge 538 (one capture, two rows) -> field
1048 -> banner 2248 -> buster 3172 -> warp 9198 -> card 18486 -> mettaur 31075 -> F3 (the chip window's
ghost; adds its row) -> popup 107511 -> result 497967 -> cursor 620802 -> the integrated variants.
No new content (viruses, bosses, chips) until the table is at zero. A reported 0 always says what it
compares: canon vs ours, or before vs after.

- F1 DONE -- MegaMan takes a hit one frame late. PARTIAL
- F2 DONE -- The mettaur row compares the wrong Mettaur attack. DONE and merged as `332e658`
- F4 DONE -- The opening row reads 1160 px since R1 rebuilt its canon state. The 1160 was the FIXTURE, not the opening
- F5 PARTIAL -- The chip rows' fixture: fire a chip after the corpse has dissolved. The prescribed route is dead, the gate is found (with corrections), and the next
intervention is named but untested
- F5b DONE -- Fire a chip in state 0x0C by delivering the press to MegaMan's AIData directly. The Sol-named gap closed with a measured fire
- F6 DONE -- tiles/gauge isolated: 538 px over 8 frames. Landed at the documented residue
- F3 DONE -- After the chip window closes, a faded copy of it stays on the field. The ghost is gone by mechanism, not masking
- F7 DONE -- The legacy `cannon` row still compares against PAUSED: 14388. Exactly as predicted: `cannon` re-pointed onto F5b's route and Align (`_chip_canon_0c("01")`
+ `ALIGN_CHIP_0C` on `afterdissolve_0x0c`), 143
- F8 DONE -- `field` isolated: 1048 px over 40 frames. DONE
- F9 DONE -- `banner` isolated: 2248 px over 58 frames. DONE
- F10 BLOCKED -- `buster` isolated: 3172 px over 32 frames. BLOCKED after the second miss, moving on
- F10b BLOCKED -- `buster`: fire in the 0x08 window with the miss-pose fix, or close the row. 
- F11 DONE -- `warp` isolated: 9198 px over 30 frames. DONE
- F17 DONE -- `mettaur` isolated: enemy_anim k=61, the Mettaur's own animation. mettaur 19698/1245/70/60824 unchanged pixels, oracle enemy_anim 2/70->1/70 (first k=61, mm_timer 70/70)
- F20b DONE -- `tiles`/`gauge` integrated: match the fixture's sprite positions to canon's state. tiles/gauge integrated 25979/3282->3865/678/8 (negative 15891 not blind), isolated still 0/0/8
- F21 PARTIAL -- `result` isolated: 497967 px over 40, its canon side is result_arrival. result 497967/31882/40/476424 -> 408337/31895/40/383600 (-89630)
- F22 NEGATIVE -- `cursor` isolated: 620802 px over 170 frames. cursor 620802/6884/170/728447 unchanged (nothing landed, branch empty, deleted)
- F22b NEGATIVE -- `cursor` isolated: match the x>=112 unshared mid-battle content on the fixture side. cursor fixture backdrop-seed probe refuted, nothing landed
- F18b PARTIAL -- `windowclose` isolated: the k=11 transient and the slide residue outside the window layer. windowclose 666451/28784/40->651885/28430/40 (k=11 BG3 transient 2447->0
- F18c PARTIAL -- `windowclose` isolated: the relocated k=9/k=10 close-frame blank/redraw. windowclose 651885/28430->650544/27555/40 (BG3 k9 1898->0, k10 1408->0, k11 0->1596
- F18d DONE -- `windowclose` isolated: the k11 gauge-body single-step redraw. windowclose 650544/27555/40->648948/27391/40 (BG3 k11 1596->0, x48-191 y0-15)
- F21d DONE -- `result`: write the window's tilemap by block copy, not 576 managed tile writes. result 408337/31895->102547/14866/40 (neg 195579 not blind), field 1048/177->0/0/40
- F12 DONE -- The chip rows' own residues, family by family -- multi-pass, stays OPEN until every chip row is 0. every chip row reads 0: the last two were areagrab (orb draw order + burst palette walk, ad653c0) and chip-use, re-cut F31b-style so canon f
- F33d PARTIAL -- Post-0x0C simulation: act after the countdown starts instead of freezing in `over`. verifier verdict: canon citations CONFIRMED (sub_800801C:10422, off_8008038 table, sub_80081A4:10617, 0x0C@0x0800811E, sub_8012DFC:8977 not 
- F37 PARTIAL -- `cursor` and `windowclose`: the sprite layer, object by object. per-object tables landed 1bee9d8 (notes only, descriptors untouched): cursor 154361/909/170 (camera-pan +15Y + Mettaur pose 4,11-vs-4,8), wi
- F37b PARTIAL -- `cursor` and `windowclose` to 0: the camera pan while the chip window is open, the Mettaur's held pose, the hand icon and bracket. pan+pose+icon landed a6bf21c: cursor 154361/909/170->130221/767/170, windowclose 27819/1938/40->19168/1878/40 (neg 316499/214890 not blind)
- F37f PARTIAL -- `windowclose` k=0..9: the 162 px marcher on the slide frames (custom.rs). mark-during-Closing KEPT unmerged (branch wt/f37f 0c05e00, custom.rs only): windowclose 1458/162/40->0/0/40, cursor 20->3/3/170
## T. Trace-driven porting (phase "porting", 2026-09-14; the plan in HANDOFF §1)

**Common to the T tickets.** The harness rows stay as free regression tests (every landing runs verify_rows on
wave, window, mettaur, popup, buster, result, field and the row a ticket names). Acceptance in this phase is
stated as state parity: "first divergence at frame N or later on scenario S", with pixels as the gate on the
same recording. Canon never changes; provenance rules as before; cite reference/bn6f file:line.

- T12 DONE -- The enemy roster out of the ROM's own index tables: every enemy_idx with its think and act entry. LANDED as 1d23394
- T7d PARTIAL -- Drive the sequencer's window states with a fixture that closes the window, and put canon's predicates under the edges. Kept UNMERGED at wt/t7d @ 24d9ef7 (8daa88d + 24d9ef7 on a merge of wt/t7c @ 9be540c)
- T9c PARTIAL -- The Gunner: implement what T9b measured (the frame-60 lever, enemy_kind, the routine, the art, the row). CORRECTION (re-stamps my earlier entry, which cited verifier findings before the verifier had returned -- the merge message 1f7efc9's claim 
- T10 DONE -- Inventory of the battle engine from the ROM's own tables: the completion checklist gets its counts. LANDED as d0e0574 (two passes: 3723b5d + fix 82c31bd)
- T7c PARTIAL -- The sequencer's missing states: the custom-screen states our side never reads, and the end edge nine frames early. Kept UNMERGED at wt/t7c @ 510b5c6 (2 commits 3def49e, 510b5c6)
- T9b PARTIAL -- The second virus (Gunner): widen the fixture to field a non-Mettaur, build the canon recipe, port its routine. Measurement pass, zero edits (worktree /tmp/bnwt/t9b-gunner clean at 974f154) -- T9's blocker is SOLVED and reproducible, the implementation
- T8 DONE -- Port the script VMs, per section 3 of the plan (map-script and chatbox text-script dispatch). Landed 752146e (branch wt/t8-script-vms @ cdd976e)
- T9 BLOCKED -- The second virus as a ported per-type routine, from a real battle recording. Blocked on a file-set widening I cannot grant
- T6 DONE -- The Mettaur as canon's per-type routine: replace the hand-written brain with the ported AI entry. Mettaur brain now canon per-type entry MettaurEntry ForMettaur_8109EF4 (objects.rs), hand-written MettaurState removed (ai.rs), battle.rs 1 
- T7 PARTIAL -- The battle end as canon's sequencer table: banner states, teardown, results hand-off. Sequencer states + TRC2 v3 export landed pixel-neutral (verify_rows: isolated all 0 incl mettaur, cursor 10/9 tear-smaller, both-rows 0
- T7b DONE -- Re-establish the sequencer evidence: fresh v3 traces, loud judge, kill-to-slide gap. Landed 0fb54d4 (branch wt/t7b-sequencer-evidence @ dce93d4, carrying wt/t7's Sequencer states)

**Common to F8-F23 (and their b-tickets) unless the ticket says otherwise.** Baseline the row (harness line plus
`tools/diffmask.py` region, plus `tools/oracle.py` where the row is supported); localize the residue to
frames and an element; find canon's routine for that element in reference/bn6f and cite it; fix src/
(or the fixture/descriptor when the residue is the fixture, with `peeked` provenance); re-run the row,
wave, window, opening, chip-cannon and the full table -- nothing may get worse, and a row that does is
reported with its numbers. No allowlist change; no alignment or region change except by measured event
(F2's rule). **Coordinator:** verify_rows on every row the report names; the verifier only for claims
beyond harness lines; a PARTIAL from a wrong guess about the cause gets one follow-up ticket; if that
also fails, mark the ticket BLOCKED and move on to the next OPEN ticket.

- T13 DONE -- Audio parity, first measurement: both sides dumped and compared sample-exact. LANDED as 9d52135
- T9d DONE -- Why the poked Gunner battle never goes live: write-watch the sequencer on the working scenario and name the difference. no writer for dword_203CA70 on either battlestart route (200f watch-write, both empty)
- T13b DONE -- The two audio defects T13 measured: the ungated hit sample, and the 6.6 ms onset offset. src/battle.rs: hit_in now armed only when the strike's take_damage() landed
- T7e DONE -- End-edge nine frames early on battle_full and the two wrong citations in src/battle.rs. battle_full sequencer 540/540 (165 window-setup k=31..195 + 8 kill-timing k=297..304, both named)
- T7f PARTIAL -- Closing-window fixture: drive 0x24 -> 0x00 -> 0x04 -> 0x08 and replace the fitted edges with canon's predicates. windowclose_full scenario confirmed 0x00 enter+leave (144..146, 22..24) and 0x04 enter+leave (147..206, 25..84) on both sides (100/100 seque
- T9e NEGATIVE -- Gunner live trigger: find what writes dword_203CA70 on the poked battle and add the row aligned by the Gunner's first attack event. trigger poke unblocks sequencer (Index_01 0x02034881 4->0->8->0x0C at f165
- T7h NEGATIVE -- battle_full's first divergence: the enemy's opening action and animation (canon CurAction 0x0A, ours 0x00). spawn arm ported: METTAUR_ACT_SPAWN=0 const + MettaurEntry init + SPAWN arm in think() at src/objects.rs:243-251,298-308,343-362
- T7i BLOCKED -- battle_full's MegaMan tail: the k=179 action/timer/anim group, then name the RNG residue. third M2 ticket in this run after T7f (PARTIAL: windowclose_full validates but SEQ04_FRAMES=60 stays peeked because asm timer arms 0x1e/0x29
- T9f NEGATIVE -- Does `eS20364C0.JumpOffset00 = 8` start the poked battle: one-shot poke test, and the first attack event's frame. one-shot poke-at 155:0x020364C0:0x08 set eS20364C0.JumpOffset00=8 and held through f199
- T9g NEGATIVE -- The Gunner attack event: the 234-frame settle window (sub_8112D9C) and MegaMan's panel row, so the row ticket becomes writable. Three captures, three negatives on docs/trace-only commit (no src/tools changes, wt/t9g-gunner-extended 801ecda, landed d43e4c0)
- T13c BLOCKED -- Audio comparison on a second scenario: chip-fire and chip-damage SFXs on the cannon route, gated by the cited predicates. Worker audited src/ before editing
- T7j PARTIAL -- Model the banner composite for sub_801E754's leave predicate: replace SEQ04_FRAMES=60 with the canonical banner-idle check. branch wt/t7j-banner-composite aa3486d (docs-only on src/battle.rs, SEQ04_FRAMES=60 unchanged in code
- T13d NEGATIVE -- Audio probe on the cannon route: what canon fires, what ours doesn't, then gate. docs-only commit landed as e87cc7f

- T7l BLOCKED -- battle_full opening action: seed canon's HOP pose at k=0 so the spawn fade no longer parks CurAction=0x00. T7l BLOCKED: worker hit tool soft-limit (80) on baseline only
- F21e DONE -- result isolated: decompose the remaining 102547/14866/40 per-object, name the next mechanism. F21e was a no-op: HEAD result isolated already 0/0/40 PASS (neg 111839, not blind) via F34b's intro_fade=0/start_state==1 + megaman_col=2 + 
- F37h NEGATIVE -- cursor: close the 3 px residue at k=37/97 from the window mark landed in F37g. F37h NEGATIVE: cursor 10/9/170 unchanged on HEAD (regression set: windowclose 0/0/40, mettaur 0/0/70, result 0/0/40 all PASS)
- F37i BLOCKED -- cursor: close the 3 px residue at k=37/97 via the BG1 backdrop drain in src/backdrop.rs. F37i BLOCKED: worker hit tool soft-limit (60) on assembly research only
- T7m BLOCKED -- battle_full MegaMan tail at k=179: the mm_state_action/mm_anim/mm_timer group, finish the release-edge gate port. T7m BLOCKED: worker hit tool soft-limit (60) on baseline capture only
- T7n PARTIAL -- battle_full RNG cadence: name the rng_cadence first-divergence at k=271 on 10/540 frames, port the read-site if a clean mirror exists. T7n PARTIAL: rng_cadence divergence named with citation
- F37j NEGATIVE -- cursor: port canon's QueueEightWordAlignedGFXTransfer drain into src/backdrop.rs so the k=37/97 BG1 seam closes. F37j NEGATIVE: both drain-timing ports regressed cursor
- T7o PARTIAL -- battle_full release-edge at k=179: relocate the SEQ04 seq-match block past t1_player_entry so the gate frees before the executor. T7o PARTIAL: SEQ04 seq-match block relocated from src/battle.rs:2533 to :3268 (after t1_player_entry), matching canon's call chain at asm00_
- T7p DONE -- battle_full RNG cadence: port the per-site mirror at sub_80C7EC8 / cbGameState_80050EC so rng_cadence drops below 10/540. T7p was a no-op: HEAD rng_cadence 9/540, already below 10/540 acceptance threshold (T7o's PARTIAL landing 784c8e5 reduced it from 10→9 by re
- F38c PARTIAL -- opening integrated 72499: port canon's intro-hunk palette/sheet assignment and the enemy's materialize animation. F38c PARTIAL: opening integrated 72499 measurement-only diagnostic
- T9h PARTIAL -- Gunner as data: port canon's per-type routine from byte_80182C4, add the harness row. T9h PARTIAL: Gunner as data per-type routine cite landed
- T7g NEGATIVE -- Land T7c's custom-screen states from the unmerged branch so battle_full's sequencer coverage extends. T7g NEGATIVE: ticket premise wrong — divergence is a fixture-level difference, not a src/battle.rs sequencer-dispatch port
- T7q PARTIAL -- battle_full k=179 group: add the seq.state gate in Actor::update so the MegaMan executor's per-tick work respects SEQ_20/SEQ_24/SEQ_00/SEQ_04. T7q PARTIAL: seq.state gate added to Actor::update (t1_player_entry early-returns Update::Nothing when seq.state in {SEQ_20, SEQ_24, SEQ_00,
- F38d PARTIAL -- opening integrated 72499: port the PAL_OBJ slot allocation in src/actor.rs and the second-cluster materialize animation in src/objects.rs. F38d PARTIAL: opening integrated 72499 unchanged
- T9i PARTIAL -- Gunner as data: fix the harness capture race so the gunner row reads 0/0/N. T9i PARTIAL: gunner race fix landed

- T7r PARTIAL -- battle_full fixture: scripted L input so self.seq.state traverses {SEQ_20, SEQ_24, SEQ_00, SEQ_04}. T7r PARTIAL: battle_full fixture seeds gauge=1 + window_pick OK + scripted A@170
- F38e BLOCKED -- opening integrated 72499: fix the diagonal spawn cells (src/battle.rs:1907-1908) and the materialize y offset (src/actor.rs:528). F38e worker found two rule conflicts that prevent landing: (1) spawn-cell fix needs per-enemy panel data per spawnEnemy_80073E2 asm00_1.s:86
- T9j PARTIAL -- Gunner as data: port the per-type routine into src/gunner.rs and align the harness row on the Gunner's first attack event. T9j PARTIAL: gunner_update per-type routine port at ForGunner_8113078 (asm32.s:10123-10142) + 4-arm state machine sub_8112F70/sub_8112FBA/su
- T7s NEGATIVE -- battle_full sequencer-timing fix: window opens at k=124 vs canon k=31 so self.seq.state traverses SEQ_20 by canon's k~31. T7s NEGATIVE: ticket acceptance unreachable under rules
- F38f PARTIAL -- opening integrated 72499: per-enemy panel bytes via src/fixture.rs and the diagonal spawn-cell fix in src/battle.rs:1907-1908. F38f PARTIAL with revert: branch (9a938d0 + 3eea157 + 8ee4346) landed on main but introduced cursor regression 1/1/170 -> 26/25/170
- T9k NEGATIVE -- Gunner as data: move Battle::gunner_ctl + Battle::impacts in src/battle.rs into GunnerEntry so gunner_update drives per-tick visible content. T9k NEGATIVE: refactor preserves gunner behavior 2850534/38237/130 (unchanged from T9j PARTIAL -- the ctl/impacts migration is relocation-on
- F38g BLOCKED -- opening integrated 72499: F38f re-land with cursor fixture state file regenerated for 67-byte descriptor. F38g BLOCKED: per-enemy panel port cherry-picked/re-implemented (commit 7c3b33f on wt/f38g-reland, diff matches F38f: src/fixture.rs +17, sr
- F36a PARTIAL -- warp integrated ~363658: baseline the residue, decompose by frame and region, port the canon mechanism. F36a PARTIAL with no code change: actual warp integrated on HEAD is 40628/11744/30 (NOT 363658 headline -- F38b event-lock pin rust_offset=5
- F35a BLOCKED -- buster integrated ~643698: baseline the residue, decompose by frame and region, port the canon mechanism. no code change, tool budget soft-cap hit at 80 before port
- T7u BLOCKED -- battle_full sequencer: port sub_801E754's banner-idle check to replace SEQ04_FRAMES=60 in src/battle.rs. code change made, but caused cursor regression: cursor 1/1/170 -> 38/37/170 (37x worse)

- F37k BLOCKED -- cursor 3 px residue at k=37/97 via per-scanline BG1 backdrop seam port. infra failures (bash exit 1, then model cold-start on resume)
- T7v BLOCKED -- battle_full RNG cadence 9/540 → 0/540: port the per-site mirror at the remaining divergence frames. no code change
- F38i PARTIAL -- opening integrated 25829: PAL_OBJ allocation order port in src/spr.rs to clear the per-object OAM colour residue. opening integrated already at 0/0 on main HEAD (8b314eb) per verify_rows — NOT 25829/931 as F38h PARTIAL commit message stated
- F37l BLOCKED -- cursor 3 px residue at k=37/97 via per-element BG1 seam cite at sub_8001C94 (asm00_0.s:3752). cursor 1/1/170 isolated: residue is 1 px at (183,5) on k=97 ONLY (k=37 already 0 after F38h merge 2d1e639), NOT 3 px at k=37/97 as ticket cl
- F36c NEGATIVE -- warp integrated 40628: port sub_8001C94's BG1 seam transition directly into src/backdrop.rs. Premise refuted by measurement, no code change
- T7w NEGATIVE -- Battle end as canon's per-state counts: name the layer of the integrated rows' 16-px band, then retire the fitted RESULTS_DELAY=110. Premise refuted by measurement
- T9l PARTIAL -- gunner 2850534/38237/130: derive this row's own backdrop seed, then split the residue by layer. LANDED as 424814d
- F39a NEGATIVE -- opening integrated 25829/931/40: the four OBJ entries canon does not draw, and the per-sprite PAL_OBJ slot. Premise refuted by measurement
- F40a BLOCKED -- gunner 2105613/38237/130: settle whether the BG3 plateau is gauge-driven, then port the chip-window auto-open that canon takes at capture ~157. Lever not settled

### T7x. battle_full SEQ_04's leave predicate is a bit test: port isBannerBusy_801E754, delete SEQ04_FRAMES and BANNER_FRAMES  *(NEGATIVE -- 2026-09-15, Ported and measured, but NOT landable: the bit-15 lifecycle is real and our mask series comes out canon-shaped)*

**Result.** Ported and measured, but NOT landable: the bit-15 lifecycle is real and our mask series comes out canon-shaped, yet spawning the banner record at SEQ_04's first run breaks rows that are clean on HEAD. Baseline correction it establishes: the ticket's 173/540 predates T7r's battle_full fixture rewrite (gauge=1 + scripted A@170 moved our window ~83 frames off canon's), so HEAD's sequencer divergence is 273/540 and the port gives 272/540 -- acceptance <=20/540 unreachable for reasons outside the named lines. Both sides' mask words: canon bit15 0xC497 at k=137..194 and 0x8084 at k=306..363 (58 exports each); ours 0xC497 k=175..232 (exactly 58) and 0x8084 k=405..461 (57) -- shape reproduced, offset is the pre-existing window-timeline gap; SEQ_04 canon k=136..195 (60) vs ours k=174..232 (59), the 1-export difference being record-update-vs-sequencer-step ordering. The regression: windowclose 0/0/40 on HEAD -> 40038/1900/40 with the port (and 63962/3557 in a hidden-record variant), cursor 3/3/170 on HEAD -> 16241/3385; a NEGATIVE-PROBE with the spawn disabled and every other port edit kept restored windowclose 0/0/40 and cursor 1/1/170, which pins the trigger to the record's bare EXISTENCE rather than to anything drawn (show/opening/clock/export/VRAM each excluded by probe, mechanism not pinned). Fitted constants 19 -> 19; the ticket's <=17 target was unreachable because SEQ04_FRAMES was tagged derived and BANNER_FRAMES/BATTLE_START_AFTER_WINDOW peeked, never fitted. Canon's own window-close record runs busy WITHOUT a visible strip (battle_full scan + windowclose HEAD 0/0), which refutes the old 'banner 289 = close+30' reading behind BATTLE_START_AFTER_WINDOW. Cite hygiene: this coordinator's mid-run steer relayed a recon cite (asm00_2.s:30907-30931, mask[6]>>12) that does not exist in the reference on main -- the worker corrected it to the file-on-disk isBannerBusy_801E754 at asm00_2.s:31072-31098 with the & 0x8000 body, and that is the cite now in the branch; a relayed recon link is never evidence. Cursor's tear also moved 1/1/170 -> 3/3/170 on HEAD independent of any ticket in this run (reference/bn6f was re-cut at 357da2a), reported and not chased per the phase rule. Branch wt/t7x-banner-bit @ 54722a9 kept UNMERGED, worktree removed; docs/worklog/T7x.md carries the full trail (three-variant probe isolation + next-worker plan). 8 capture runs, all step-mandated (over the ticket's <=3 in letter, reported). Child worker-hyper glm-5.3-flash:high; acceptance review returned criterion-1 not-satisfied.
**Why.** battle_full's trace diverges on 173/540 sequencer frames — 165 at k=31..195 (window setup) + 8 at k=297..304 (kill timing) (tools/harness.py:1484). T7u BLOCKED ($0.395): it replaced the fitted count with a `banner_idle(&BannerComposite)` check, got 273/540 → 256/540 and regressed cursor 1/1/170 → 38/37/170; not landed. Its diagnosis — "banner_at 30-frame countdown defeats banner_idle before the Banner struct spawns" — says the predicate was wrong in *shape*, not in kind: canon's is not about a banner object, it is one bit test. src/battle.rs:4550-4560 already holds the measured pattern from the real ROM (PAUSED, enemy HP forced 0, Start@10): teardown store at=0x0801BEDC lr=0x080081B9, mask 0x4497→0x0084 at frame 48, "bit 15 is set back a moment later by the ENEMY DELETED banner going up (sub_801E792's sub_801BECC(1<<15), asm00_2.s:31055-31112)", the mask reads 0x8084 (bit 15 set) across 48..105 and 0x0084 from 106. bn6f renamed the reader for exactly this: `isBannerBusy_801E754` = `HudElementMask & 0x8000` (asm00_2.s:31071-31097), with T7d's note that sequencer state 0x04 "writes 0x08 only when it returns 0" (reference/bn6f/docs/renames.md:136). Ours carries two fitted counts instead: `SEQ04_FRAMES: u16 = 60` (src/battle.rs:1186, leave at :3301) and `BANNER_FRAMES: u16 = 58 // provenance: peeked` (:1161).

**Coordinator note (2026-09-15).** F42a (the battle-HUD element mask on gunner) and F41a (the integrated band) were NOT admitted this run -- their objectives already carry two consecutive non-landings (T9l PARTIAL + F40a BLOCKED, and F36c + T7w NEGATIVE). So this ticket is self-contained: if step 2 names bit 15's setter/clear, YOU add the mask bit; there is no earlier ticket to build on.

**Files.** src/battle.rs (bit 15 of the HUD mask, SEQ_04's leave :3301, SEQ04_FRAMES :1186, BANNER_FRAMES :1161, the banner arm :2556/:2579 — nothing else), src/banner.rs (only the record's own completion that clears the bit), tools/trace.py (watch only), tools/probe.py (watch only), docs/coverage/battle_full.md (notes)

**Do.**
1. `tools/trace.py record/diff --align row:battle_full` on HEAD → *report the sequencer divergence (expected 173/540) and our k-spans for SEQ_08/20/24/00/04/08.*
2. Read isBannerBusy_801E754 (asm00_2.s:31071-31097), spawnBannerRecord_801E792 (:31055-31112) and clearBattleHudElements_801BED6 (:25575) and their callers → *report the site that sets bit 15, the one that clears it, and the counter/timer the clear waits on (T7d's 0x1e / 0x293 arms named).*
3. After the change, first the cheap gate: `tools/harness.py --only cursor --ui isolated` → *report cursor before/after; if it moves off 1/1/170 stop, report NEGATIVE with both sides' mask series (T7u's failure mode).*
4. Port: set bit 15 at the banner-spawn site, clear it at step 2's cited site, make SEQ_04's leave `!mask & BANNER_BUSY`, delete SEQ04_FRAMES and BANNER_FRAMES → *report the diff, the cite count, fitted-constant count before/after (HEAD 19, target ≤17).*
5. Re-run step 1 → *report the new divergence count and SEQ_04's enter/leave k on both sides.*
6. `tools/verify_rows.py` (`row:ui=` form) → *report the 67-row table, that the mask export at :1762 now comes from the ported bitset, and that no other row's mask series changed.*

**Rules.** Only the named files. The leave predicate is a bit test on a ported mask — never a frame count, never `banner_age >= N`, never a per-row case; SEQ04_FRAMES and BANNER_FRAMES are deleted, not retuned. If bit 15's clear site is not a ported routine, report the reading and keep the constant (NEGATIVE). No new harness row, no alignment/descriptor/flag change (FIXTURE_SIZE 67); fitted count must not rise; canon never changes; ≤3 capture runs; tool budget ≤100.

**Acceptance.** battle_full sequencer divergence ≤20/540 (from 173) with SEQ_04 entering and leaving on canon's k; both frame constants gone; isBannerBusy_801E754 cited at asm00_2.s:31071 in src/battle.rs; cursor still 1/1/170; mettaur 0/0/70; windowclose 0/0/40; every isolated pixel row 0/0; no allowlist change; fitted ≤17. A NEGATIVE with both sides' mask series and the sequencer edges also closes it.

**Measure and report.** rows: battle_full (trace), cursor, windowclose, mettaur, result, field, wave, popup, the chip rows. frames: 540/170/40/70/40/40/90/80/30. total/worst: divergence before/after, SEQ_04's span, both sides' mask words at 40..115. region: self.seq.state k=31..195. commit. one line of mechanism. one line of what is unverified (whether the 8 kill-timing frames at k=297..304 also shift, and whether bit 15's clear is the same event that ends opening's ENEMY DELETED banner).

**Coordinator:** dispatch first and alone (its Files. name src/battle.rs, which no other live ticket touches). Worker = the run profile's resolved worker (T7u's class $0.395); verifier = the other family, on the step-2 clear-site cite. ≤$0.35 expected, ≤$0.70 cap, tool budget ≤100. Advances **M2** (165 of battle_full's 173 diverging frames) and the no-fitted-constants invariant.
